(Camden comment): Feel free to delete everything I typed in here once it has been changed, or use a different iteration to implement said changes :D

### Initialization of the bot
``` python 
Set up the webdriver (assuming you have already installed it)
options = Options()
options.add_argument('--profile-directory=user')
options.add_argument(r"--user-data-dir=app-data")
driver = uc.Chrome(options=options)

Navigate to the skinport.com/cart page
driver.get("https://skinport.com/market?sort=date&order=desc")
```
This function (provided by Camden): from my understanding searches the page for a specific item and adds it to the cart, then proceeds to checkout
and saves the items data in a cookie file... 
(Comment from Camden):
This is mostly correct, however, I think a cookie file should be used on the store page when going through each item and checking for discount, not when checking out. By doing this, it will function quicker like you are mentioning. The data isn't very important to me and I am mainly using it so it doesn't try to purchase items with the discount and price variables requested that have already been purchased so that it saves times searching through the page which is constantly updated with more listings. If there is also a way to wipe that data each time the bot is stopped and creating a new cookie file to repeat the process that would be helpful.

(Comment from Evan): Camden,  I think this function will work well. I intented to add your filtered items soon after I get the bot to working. I think I would be a great idea to make a SQLite3 database to store the items and their data. I think this would be a great way to keep track of the items. I believe it will allow the bot to run faster then before. If you would like to start on creating Database functions then I will prepare the helper functions with the new functionalities.

(Comment from Camden): I'm not familiar with creating database functions but if there is information you need provided of what to avoid I can give a few examples here and then add more later on my own.

Example: Any item with the name "XM1014", any knife/daggers with the word "StatTrak" in it, any item with the word "case" in it

Second Function: (Provided by Camden)
I will write a mark up of my understanding shortly

TLDR: this will help check out items, and save them into a cookie.

(Camden comment): I'm not entirely sure if some of this is redundant, I used it to reset the loop of checking for items if checkout was unsuccessful. I would like to have a function added that can navigate back to the original URL and click the live button again to repeat the process of searching for items.

    while "cart" in driver.current_url:
        time.sleep(1)

    # Wait for the user to navigate back to the skinport.com/cart page
    while "cart" not in driver.current_url:
        time.sleep(1)

    # Perform the function again if the user navigates back to the link
    if driver.current_url == 'https://skinport.com/market?sort=date&order=desc':
        # Wait for the cart element to have a value of 1
        cart_count = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            EC.text_to_be_present_in_element((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".CartButton-count"), "1"))

        # Find the first element and click it
        cart_button = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".CartButton-button")
        actions = ActionChains(driver)
        actions.move_to_element(cart_button).click().perform()

        # Wait for the second element to be clickable and click it
        view_cart_button = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".SubmitButton.CartDropdown-checkout")))
        actions.move_to_element(view_cart_button).click().perform()

    # Click the checkboxes
    try:
        check_box1 = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, "input[name='tradelock']")))
        check_box2 = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, "input[name='cancellation']")))

        # Perform the checkbox clicking actions using action chains
        actions = ActionChains(driver)
        actions.move_to_element(check_box1).click().perform()
        actions.move_to_element(check_box2).click().perform()

        # Update the cookies to store the state of the checkboxes
        tradelock_value = str(check_box1.is_selected()).lower()
        cancellation_value = str(check_box2.is_selected()).lower()
        driver.add_cookie({"name": "tradelock", "value": tradelock_value})
        driver.add_cookie({"name": "cancellation", "value": cancellation_value})

        # Click the "Proceed to Checkout" button
        proceed_to_checkout_button = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.CSS_SELECTOR, "div.SubmitButton-title")))
        proceed_to_checkout_button.click()

        # Click the CVC element
        pyautogui.moveTo(1262, 348)

        
        print("Checkboxes clicked successfully!")

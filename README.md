#### Introduction:

This application is intended to provide alogritmic trading options that watch for price fluxuations that will indicate a decrease in price, or discount.

#### Requirements
The code will open a website. The website lists in-game itmes. The items have a discount. If the discount is of 27% or greater then automatically add them to cart. The price range and discount ranges are set, but future iterations will allow for easy adjustments. 

The next update will include specifying the "*types*" (cases, descriptions, conditions, etc.) of trade item that will be exclude from the search parameters. 

#### Analysis

For the development of this application, with the help of the Author, I will create a simple waterfall diagram that will allow us to issues copies of the application as itended throught each step of the process. Ideally, this should be simple, and agile upon developement.

Thanks to Camdem, and inital copy of the first iteration of code has been provided. Under the MIT open source copywrite laws, I've obtained a working copy and will soon prepare an easy to use Developement Enviorment. 

So far this application uses only Python, but after a closer look, I've realized that a simple User Interface may be necessary. It is a continued work in progress. 

Before I begin: I will upload a progress model that includes class diagrams, and UML charts that simplify the flow of instructions, and data operations. 

#### Development

To be continued.

#### Packages included:

- *Undetected Chromedriver*
- *PyAutoGUI*
- *Selenium*
- *Webdriver*
- *Time*
